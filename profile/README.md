## Overview

This project is developed as part of a module at the University of Applied Sciences in Berlin to create a tool that crawls and analyzes news and posts from various sources. The tool utilizes a Topic Modeling model to assign topics to articles and performs sentiment analysis. The results will be presented in a frontend for easy visualization.

## Features

- **News Crawling:** The tool efficiently collects news articles and posts from diverse sources.
- **Topic Modeling:** Utilizes a sophisticated model to categorize articles into relevant topics.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Provides insights into the sentiment expressed in the collected content.
- **Frontend Visualization:** The topics from different news sources are presented in a user-friendly frontend for easy interpretation.

These features are still under construction, and their implementation is contingent on available time and resources.
